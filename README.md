# Django Earth Materials

Django Earth Materials is a simple app for integrating the British Geological Survey's [Earth Material Class (Rock Classification Scheme)](https://data.bgs.ac.uk/doc/EarthMaterialClass.html)[^1] into your Django app. The primary goal of this app is to help standardise the input of lithological information in Earth Science databases.

## Why?

Inconsistencies in the way rock types are reported in geological datasets are a major barrier to compilation, aggregation and analysis of geoscience data. Standards such as the BGS Earth Material Class exist to address this issue but there is little way of enforcing adherance to such a scheme other than asking politely. Django Earth Materials fixes this issue (at least for online applications) by providing `EarthMaterialFK`, `EarthMaterialM2M` and `EarthMaterialOneToOne` relationship fields that will validate user input against the BGS classification scheme.

## Installation

First install the application with pip using

    pip install django_earth_science

then add `earth_science` to your installed apps like so

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        earth_science,
        ...
    ]

Finally, add the earth_science urls to your project urls

    urlpatterns = [
        ...
        path('earth_science', include('earth_science.urls')),
        ...
    ]

> **_NOTE:_**  Don't forget to run `python manage.py migrate earth_science` to migrate the schema and load the included data fixtures!


## Usage

Django Earth Materials provides an `EarthMaterialFK`, `EarthMaterialM2M` and `EarthMaterialOneToOne` field to help you integrate the app into your project as follows:

    from earth_science.fields import EarthMaterialFK, EarthMaterialM2M, EarthMaterialOneToOne

    class SomeModel(models.Model):
        lithology = EarthMaterialOneToOne()

Each field automatically points to the EarthMaterial model and also sub-classes fields provided by `django-treewidget` in order to utilize the `jstree` javascript widget in forms. When viewing this model in the Django Admin site, you will now be presented with a field like this,

![Visualise](https://geoluminate.github.io/django-earth-materials/images/admin_widget.PNG)

where admin can select one or more items depending on the type of field used. 

> **_NOTE:_**  The above image is taken from an admin site that utilizes the [Djang Grappelli](https://grappelliproject.com) admin interface. If you don't use Grappelli then your field may look slightly different.


## Settings

Django Earth Materials includes two settings, `EARTH_MATERIALS_INCLUDE` and `EARTH_MATERIALS_EXCLUDE`, that can be declared in your `settings.py` file to control what tree nodes are available in the form widget. These are useful if your project is dedicated to a specific rock group. For example, 

    EARTH_MATERIALS_INCLUDE = [
        'Igneous rock and sediment',
        'Metamorphic rock',
        ]

will restrict the widget to only igneous and metamorphic rock types. Alternatively,

    EARTH_MATERIALS_EXCLUDE = [
        'Superficial deposit (natural and/or artificial)'
        ]
        
will exclude artificial materials from the widget.

> **_NOTE:_** If both `EARTH_MATERIALS_INCLUDE` and `EARTH_MATERIALS_EXCLUDE` are found in `settings.py`, only `EARTH_MATERIALS_INCLUDE` will be used.

> **_WARNING:_**  The method currently used to include or exclude fields has not been thoroughly tested performance wise. You may encounter issues using large lists of includes or excludes.

## Customisation

The widget can be customised either by supplying the `settings` and `treeoptions` arguments to the model field or by providing customisation options project wide in `settings.py` as `TREEWIDGET_SETTINGS` and `TREEWIDGET_TREEOPTIONS`. See the readme at [`django-treewidget`](https://github.com/netzkolchose/django-treewidget) for further instructions on customisation.

The following settings are recommended here but not required:

> **_NOTE:_**  To use, place these in your `settings.py` file.

    TREEWIDGET_SETTINGS = {
                'search':True, # adds a search bar to the widget that filters tree nodes
                }
                
    TREEWIDGET_TREEOPTIONS = {
        "core" : {
            "themes" : {
                "icons": False, # removes the folder icon next to each item
            },
        },
        "plugins" : [ "checkbox" ] # adds checkboxes next to each item
    }


## Issues & Inconsistencies

The following pages returned a 404 during the data gathering stage so no information could be retrieved from it or any associated children:

* A child of Sediment and sedimentary rock could not be found at http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/EarthMaterialClass/RockName/PS_PS&P
